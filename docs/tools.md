# Tools Used in Our Project

In our project, we utilized a variety of tools and technologies to build a robust and efficient application. These tools played a crucial role in enhancing our development process and delivering a high-quality product.

## **Tailwind CSS**

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allowed us to rapidly build and style our user interface. Its utility classes helped us create consistent designs while maintaining flexibility. Learn more about [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## **Next.js**

We chose Next.js as our frontend framework for its server-side rendering capabilities, which significantly improved the performance and SEO of our application. The built-in routing system and developer experience were also major benefits. Discover more about [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## **Redux**

Managing the state of our application was made efficient with Redux. It provided a predictable state management system that helped us handle complex data flows and interactions. Learn more about [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

## **Django**

Django served as the backbone of our backend, offering a powerful and versatile framework for building web applications. Its built-in features, such as the ORM and authentication system, expedited our development process. Explore more about [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

## **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**

For secure authentication and authorization, we implemented JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This technology allowed us to transmit user information between the frontend and backend in a secure and efficient manner. Learn more about [JWT](https://jwt.io/).
